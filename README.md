### 👨‍💻 About Louise

🖥 I'm a web developer and technical writer passionate about educating new developers and non-technical users about web development, demystifying complex topics, and empowering them to learn new skills and technologies they thought they couldn't.

🎓 As an RGU graduate, I'm always keen to continue learning. I've participated in the MLH Pre-Fellowship and WorldSkills Advanced Web Design Heat.

📝 In my spare time, I write guides to empower non-technical users to learn more about their websites and other technical areas such as email hosting and domains. I also write about useful developer tools and self-hosting applications.
